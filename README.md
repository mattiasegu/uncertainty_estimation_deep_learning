# A General Framework for Uncertainty Estimation in Deep Learning
This repository provides the code used to implement the framework to provide deep learning models with total uncertainty estimates as described in ["A General Framework for Uncertainty Estimation in Deep Learning" (Loquercio, Seg√π, Scaramuzza. RA-L 2020)](http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/docs/RAL20_Loquercio.pdf).
The code used to train and evaluate our framework on CIFAR10 is here provided and ready to use.

## Video
CHECK OUT a video demo of our framework [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7n-bRS5vSM).
Watch the [ICRA2020 Pitch Video](https://youtu.be/HZOxLgsk8E0) for an introduction to this work.

## Prerequisites
- torch 1.4.0
- torchvision 0.5.0

## Virtual Environment
If you want, you can run our code inside a Virtual Environment.
To do so, just run the following commands:
```
$ virtualenv venv --python=python3.6
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Pre-trained Models
You can download pre-trained models with and without dropout at training time [HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gu0nUxzcj2gonon55L0oi6kTjeD6T1v7?usp=sharing).
Move the pre-trained models in the `./checkpoint` folder. If it does not exist yet, create it in the main directory.

## Prerequisites
- torch 1.4.0
- torchvision 0.5.0

## Data
The framework is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, automatically downloaded when calling `torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(...)` with `download=True`.

## Training
You can start a training with

```$ python train.py --model_name resnet18```
 
or you can resume the training with 

```$ python train.py -r --model_name resnet18```


## Evaluation
Evaluate with 

```
$ python eval.py -r -b \
    --load_model_name ${model_to_load} \
    --test_model_name ${model_to_test} \
    --p ${p} \
    --min_variance ${min_variance} \
    --noise_variance ${noise_variance} \
    --num_samples ${num_samples}
```

 You can choose which model to test with the flag `--test_model_name` and which checkpoint to load with the flag `--load_model_name`. For example, you can load the trained weights from `resnet18` and test them with `resnet18_dropout_adf` using the flags

`--load_model_name resnet18_dropout --test_model_name resnet18_dropout_adf`

If you want to test the model that was already trained with dropout layers, use  

`--load_model_name resnet18_dropout --test_model_name resnet18_dropout_adf`

If you want to use Monte-Carlo dropout at test time, add the flag `-m`.
If you want to use the adf model, select a `test_model_name` ending with `adf`.
If you want to test our complete method, combine both, e.g.

```
$ python eval.py -r -b -m \
    --load_model_name resnet18 \
    --test_model_name resnet18_dropout_adf \
    --p 0.02 \
    --min_variance 1e-3 \
    --noise_variance 1e-3 \
    --num_samples 20
```
